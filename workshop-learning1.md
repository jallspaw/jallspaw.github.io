# _Learning how to learn_ from accidents and surprises

Learning from accidents and surprises is difficult but essential. Learning requires deliberate effort to understand how events arise from within the system, how responses can become more effective, and how events can be used to enhance resilience across the enterprise. 

### What

This workshop provides students intensive, fast paced, highly focused training in how to shape the response to accidents and surprises so as to optimize organizational learning from events. 

The basic workshop comprises two half-day sessions with 3 to 4 written exercises in between. The target audience for this workshop is senior engineering staff with experience in disturbance response and post-event review. 

* Fundamentals of critical thinking in systems safety
* Going beyond classical “Newtonian” linear thinking and the “human error” label
* Overview of accident models and analytical choices in constructing an event timeline
* Defensible critique of existing accident/postmortem reports; what makes one valuable?
* Debriefing facilitation methods and approaches to exploring anomaly response in team settings, based on _cognitive task analysis_ approaches
* Recognizing and describing phenomena such as cognitive fixation, plan continuation, automation surprises, normalization of deviance, procedural drift, and system resilience
* Pragmatics of artifact collection, analysis, and documentation

### Why

Workshop participation represents an _organizational_ investment in preparedness. 

Coping with the aftermath of an accident or surprise can be daunting. Successful organizations move beyond naive short-term “fixes” and attempt to learn as much as possible from events, and demonstrate that learning. Extracting the maximum value from such experiences requires understanding both how such events arise and how their consequences impact technical and organizational capacity. 

Building a cadre of post-event facilitators increases the in-house capacity to deal with events and their aftermaths. 

### How

Workshops are hands-on experiences that engage participants and address real-world conditions. Conducted by experts with experience in multiple domains, the two-day workshop emphasizes the investigation of events, the preparation and conduct of post-mortem debriefings, how to build useful summaries of learning for different audiences, creating psychological and social support for participants, preparing public accounts and status pages, and useful tools for individual event analysis and tracking issues.

A key assumption in this course is that all organizations are different. They have different histories, constraints, goals, and perspectives. Therefore, the material and dialogue should make sense in that context, not just in the abstract.

By honing skills over time, internal event response experience provides near-immediate access that can continue to grow with the organization.

Common questions that arise from organizations who have an existing post-event practice include:

* What events warrant doing a review, and which don’t?
* How do you find patterns across multiple events?
* What role do procedures and process have in post-event reviews?
* How do you support participants of a debriefing who are reluctant to say why they did (or didn’t) do something?
* How do you treat events that are statistically “one-in-a-million”?

Maximum class size is 20.
