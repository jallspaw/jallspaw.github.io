# _Learning how to learn_ from accidents and surprises

Coping with the aftermath of an accident or surprise can be daunting. Successful organizations move beyond naive short-term “fixes” and attempt to learn as much as possible from events, and demonstrate that learning. Extracting maximum value from such experiences requires analytical inquiry that can extract knowledge from (technical and organizational) experts about how such events arise and how their consequences impact the system and organizational capacity.


Learning from accidents and surprises is difficult, but essential. Learning requires deliberate effort to understand how events arise from within the system, how responses to accidents can become more effective, and how events are used to enhance resilience across the enterprise.  Building an available bench of post-event facilitators increases the in-house capacity to deal with events and their aftermaths, and provides momentum for cross-organizational learning. Workshop participation represents an _organizational_ investment in preparedness.

### **What**

This workshop provides your staff intensive, fast-paced, focused training in how to shape the response to accidents and surprises to optimize organizational learning from events. The target audience for this workshop are staff with experience in disturbance response and post-incident review, or who are responsible for facilitating incident management debriefings.

The workshop covers systems safety fundamentals and practical techniques for implementing them, such as:

* Fundamentals of critical thinking in systems safety
* Moving beyond classical “Newtonian” linear thinking and the “human error” label
* An overview of accident models and analytical choices in constructing an event timeline.
* Defensible critique of existing accident/postmortem reports: what makes one valuable?
* Debriefing facilitation methods and approaches for exploring anomaly response in team settings, based on cognitive task analysis approaches, with a focus on eliciting knowledge from the team.
* Pragmatics of artifact collection, analysis, and documentation.

In addition, we will discuss common challenges that organizations with an existing post-event practice face. Some of these include:

* What incidents warrant doing a review, and which don’t?
* How do you find patterns across multiple events?
* What role do procedures and process have in post-event reviews?
* How do you support participants of a debriefing who are reluctant to say why they did (or didn’t) do something?
* How do you treat events that are seen as “one-in-a-million”?


### **How**

This workshop includes two half-day sessions with 3 to 4 written exercises between sessions. These hands-on experiences engage participants and address real-world conditions. Led by experts with experience in many domains, the workshop emphasizes investigation as an exploration of events, the preparation and conduct of post-incident debriefings, how to build useful summaries of learning for different audiences, creating psychological and social support for participants, preparing public accounts and status pages, and useful tools for individual event analysis and tracking issues.

A key assumption in this course is that all organizations are different. They have different histories, constraints, goals, and perspectives. Thus, the material and dialogue should make sense in that context, not in the abstract. To provide the most benefit for an organization, we will adapt the workshop based on how the group has experienced “post-mortem” reviews in the past, what challenges and/or barriers they have faced in learning from events, and what their goals are for getting more out of post-incident analysis.


Maximum class size is 20.
